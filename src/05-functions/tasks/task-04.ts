 * The school wants to display an attendance report.
 * The report should include:
 * - Total Present
 * - Total Absent

 * The report is displayed directly on the console.
 * Student Tasks:
 * - Create a function named printAttendanceReport.
 * - The function receives the attendance array.
 * - Use looping and conditions.
 * - Display the report inside the function.
 * - The function should not return any value.
